# 04 · Architecture

Optimize for change. The best architecture is the one that's cheapest to evolve safely.

## Boundaries & coupling

- Separate concerns into clear layers (transport ↔ domain ↔ persistence). Don't leak DB models into HTTP handlers.
- Depend on abstractions, not concretions; inject dependencies (no hidden globals/singletons).
- Keep the domain core free of framework and I/O details (ports & adapters / hexagonal).
- High cohesion within a module, loose coupling between modules.

## API & service contracts

- Treat APIs as contracts: explicit schemas, versioning, and backward-compatibility rules.
- Validate at the boundary; return typed, documented errors.
- Make breaking changes additive when possible; deprecate before removing.
- Define and document SLAs/SLOs for latency and availability.

## Reliability patterns

- **Idempotency:** writes triggered by retries/at-least-once delivery must be safe to repeat (idempotency keys).
- **Timeouts everywhere:** no unbounded waits on dependencies.
- **Retries with backoff + jitter**, capped, and only for transient/idempotent operations.
- **Circuit breakers / bulkheads** to contain failures and prevent cascades.
- **Graceful degradation:** define what the system does when a dependency is down.
- Design for failure: assume any remote call can fail, be slow, or duplicate.

## State & data

- Single source of truth per piece of data; avoid dual writes without an outbox/saga.
- Make schema changes backward/forward compatible (expand → migrate → contract).
- Prefer events for cross-service communication over synchronous chains where coupling hurts.
- Be explicit about consistency model (strong vs eventual) per use case.

## Observability (non-negotiable in production)

- **Structured logs** with correlation/trace IDs; log decisions and errors, not noise.
- **Metrics:** RED (Rate, Errors, Duration) for services; USE for resources.
- **Traces** across service boundaries for latency attribution.
- Define alerts on symptoms (SLO burn) rather than every cause.
- Health/readiness endpoints distinct and meaningful.

## Configuration & deployment

- Configuration via environment, not code; never branch on hardcoded hostnames.
- Feature-flag risky changes; support safe rollout and instant rollback.
- Keep deployments boring: small, frequent, reversible.

## Decision hygiene

- Record significant decisions as ADRs (see `templates/architecture-doc-template.md`).
- State the trade-offs and the rejected alternatives, not just the choice.

## Architecture checklist

- [ ] Clear separation of concerns; domain isolated from I/O.
- [ ] External calls: timeout + retry + failure behavior defined.
- [ ] Writes are idempotent where retries are possible.
- [ ] Schema changes are backward compatible.
- [ ] Logs/metrics/traces emitted with correlation IDs.
- [ ] Significant decisions captured in an ADR.
