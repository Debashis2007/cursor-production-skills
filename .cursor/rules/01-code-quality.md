# 01 · Code Quality

Write code for the next engineer who has to maintain it at 3 a.m. during an incident.

## Readability & structure

- Functions do one thing. If you need "and" to describe it, split it.
- Keep functions short; extract when nesting exceeds ~3 levels.
- Prefer early returns (guard clauses) over deep `if/else` pyramids.
- No dead code, commented-out blocks, or unused imports/vars.
- Keep modules cohesive: things that change together live together.

## Naming

- Names reveal intent: `maxRetries`, not `mr`; `isEligible`, not `flag`.
- Booleans read as predicates: `hasAccess`, `isExpired`, `shouldRetry`.
- Avoid abbreviations except universally understood ones (`id`, `url`, `db`).
- Functions are verbs (`fetchUser`); collections are plural (`users`).

## Comments & docs

- Comment **why**, not **what**. The code already says what.
- Document non-obvious trade-offs, invariants, and gotchas.
- Public functions/classes get a docstring: purpose, params, returns, raises.
- Delete comments that restate the line below them.

## Error handling

- Fail fast and loudly at boundaries; degrade gracefully in the hot path.
- Catch the narrowest exception you can handle; never bare `except`/`catch(e){}`.
- Always include context in errors: what failed, with what inputs.
- Don't use exceptions for normal control flow.
- Clean up resources deterministically (`with`, `defer`, `try/finally`, RAII).

## Testing

- Every bug fix gets a regression test that fails before the fix.
- Test behavior, not implementation; avoid asserting on private internals.
- Cover the unhappy paths: nulls, empties, timeouts, duplicates, boundaries.
- Tests are deterministic: no real network, no `sleep`-based timing, no shared state.
- Name tests by scenario: `returns_403_when_token_expired`.

## Types & contracts

- Use the strongest typing the language offers; avoid `any`/`interface{}`/`Object`.
- Make illegal states unrepresentable (enums, sum types, value objects).
- Validate and parse at the edge; keep the core working on trusted types.

## Dependencies

- Prefer the standard library; add a dependency only when it earns its keep.
- Pin versions; review transitive footprint and license before adding.
- Wrap volatile third-party APIs behind a thin internal interface.

## Quality gates (must pass)

- [ ] Formatter and linter clean.
- [ ] No new compiler/type warnings.
- [ ] Cyclomatic complexity of new functions stays reasonable.
- [ ] Public API changes have tests and docs.
