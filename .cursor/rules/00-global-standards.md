# 00 · Global Standards

These are the baseline expectations for all work in this repository. Other rules
(`01`–`05`) extend, never contradict, this file.

## Operating principles

1. **Correctness first, then clarity, then cleverness.** Never trade correctness for brevity.
2. **Evidence over assertion.** Back claims with code references, measurements, or docs. If you're inferring, say so.
3. **Smallest reversible step.** Prefer changes that are easy to review and easy to roll back. Call out blast radius for anything risky.
4. **No silent scope creep.** Do exactly what was asked. Propose adjacent improvements separately rather than bundling them.
5. **Production realism.** Assume real traffic, real money, real on-call. Code that "works locally" is not done.

## Definition of Done

A change is done only when:

- [ ] It compiles/builds and passes existing tests.
- [ ] New behavior has tests (happy path + at least one failure/edge case).
- [ ] Errors are handled explicitly; no swallowed exceptions.
- [ ] Inputs from outside the trust boundary are validated.
- [ ] No secrets, tokens, or PII are committed or logged.
- [ ] Public behavior changes are documented (README/CHANGELOG/docstring).
- [ ] Linters/formatters pass; no new warnings introduced.

## Communication style

- Lead with the answer or the recommendation, then the reasoning.
- Use checklists and tables for anything with more than three parts.
- Rank findings by severity: **Critical → High → Medium → Low → Nit.**
- When uncertain, state the assumption and the confidence level, then proceed.
- Never fabricate file paths, APIs, config keys, or command output.

## Working with the codebase

- Match existing conventions (style, structure, naming) before introducing new ones.
- Read before you write: inspect neighboring files to learn the local patterns.
- Prefer extending existing abstractions over adding parallel ones.
- Leave the code better than you found it, but keep refactors separate from features.

## When to stop and ask

Stop and ask the human before:

- Destructive or irreversible actions (data deletion, force-push, schema drops).
- Changing a public API contract or a security boundary.
- Adding a new heavyweight dependency or service.
- Anything that materially changes cost, latency, or availability.

## Anti-patterns to avoid

- Cargo-culting patterns without understanding them.
- "TODO: fix later" left in shipped code without a tracked issue.
- Broad `try/except` that hides root causes.
- Comments that narrate the code instead of explaining intent.
